useReducer Hook
-----------------

useState is not the only way to manage state in react,useReducer also can be used to manage state and re-rendeer component when the state changes.

why useReducer? - It gives more concrete way to handle complex state. The state is updated based on action being sent

see two small apps using useReducer
- CounterApp : simple calculation only but still can use
- TodoApp : some complex calculation , so good to go for useReducer
