how to create custom-hook
=========================

See file Demo_Need_For_CustomHook.jsx

this is working well 
there is a state for name and onChange functionality 
however on page load state is lost

so we need to store this value in localStorage so that on page load is value was entered it will get fetched and displayed.
for this we will use custom hook ""
